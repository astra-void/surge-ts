# surge-ts

`surge-ts` is a TypeScript type checker written in Rust, focused on
`tsc`-compatible diagnostics for `noEmit`-style project checking. It is not a
full TypeScript compiler and does not claim full TypeScript compatibility:
compatibility is measured, per feature and per project, against the upstream
compiler as an oracle. The engineering priorities are practical checking
performance, bounded memory use, deterministic output (identical diagnostics
across repeated runs and across serial/parallel execution), and validation on
real-world projects rather than synthetic claims.

The workspace ships an embeddable library (`surge-ts`, with the lower-level
`surge-ts-checker`) and a CLI (`surge-ts-cli`, binary name `surge`). The stable
API surface and the exact-parity feature list live in
[PUBLIC_API.md](PUBLIC_API.md).

## Quick start

Build the CLI (release profile — debug builds are much slower and not
representative):

```bash
cargo build --release -p surge-ts-cli
```

Check a project the way `tsc --noEmit` would:

```bash
target/release/surge --project path/to/tsconfig.json
```

```text
src/index.ts(11,7): error TS2322: Type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'.
src/index.ts(19,12): error TS2339: Property 'missing' does not exist on type 'User'.
```

The exit code is `0` when there are no diagnostics and `2` when there are.
A single `.ts` file can also be passed positionally instead of
`--project`. Useful run-level flags: `--jobs <auto|N>` (worker threads; `auto`
is the default), `--maxDiagnostics <N>` (cap displayed diagnostics), and
`--pretty <true|false|auto>` (tsc-style code frames).

Machine-readable diagnostics on stdout:

```bash
target/release/surge --project path/to/tsconfig.json --format json
```

```json
{
  "diagnostics": [
    {
      "code": "TS2322",
      "fileName": "src/index.ts",
      "message": "Type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'.",
      "span": { "start": 201, "end": 208 },
      "line": 11,
      "column": 7
    }
  ]
}
```

(Abbreviated to the first diagnostic; the array carries every diagnostic.)

Run statistics on stderr (diagnostics output on stdout is unchanged):

```bash
target/release/surge --project path/to/tsconfig.json --extendedDiagnostics
```

```text
Extended diagnostics:
  files:                                 64
    source files:                         1
    dependency declaration files:         0
    default lib files:                   63
  diagnostics:                            5
  jobs:                                auto
  allocator:                         system
  config/project loading:           0.398ms
  ...
  checking:                        18.902ms
  total:                           22.772ms
  peak physical footprint:         40.1 MiB
  finish physical footprint:       40.1 MiB
  peak rss:                        43.5 MiB
```

A versioned machine-readable run report (`schemaVersion: 1`), written to a
file:

```bash
target/release/surge --project path/to/tsconfig.json --reportJson report.json
```

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "summary": {
    "files": 64,
    "sourceFiles": 1,
    "dependencyDeclarationFiles": 0,
    "defaultLibFiles": 63,
    "diagnostics": 5,
    "wallTimeMs": 29.521,
    "jobs": "auto",
    "allocator": "system"
  },
  "phases": { "checkingMs": 23.965, "totalMs": 29.521 },
  "memory": {
    "peakPhysicalBytes": 43598280,
    "finishPhysicalBytes": 43598280,
    "peakRssBytes": 47153152
  }
}
```

(The `phases` object is abbreviated here; the full schema, including
`--memoryReport` and the guarantee that reporting flags never change the
diagnostics output, is documented in [PUBLIC_API.md](PUBLIC_API.md).)

## Status at a glance

Verified at commit `f841633` on 2026-09-08 (Apple M1 Pro, macOS 27.0, release
build, TypeScript 7.0.2 oracle). The full snapshot, including the measurement
caveats, is in [CURRENT_STATUS.md](CURRENT_STATUS.md); the numbers below are
carried from it rather than re-measured here.

| Gate | Result |
| --- | ---: |
| Workspace tests (`cargo nextest run --workspace`) | 1859 / 1859 |
| Oracle preset sweep, normal gate | 148 / 148 |
| Oracle preset sweep, `--strictMessages` | 148 / 148 |
| Oracle preset sweep, `--strictSpans` | 148 / 148 |
| Real projects at exact parity | ky 0/0, unnamed 0/0, ofetch 1/1, zod 21/21 |

The normal gate is diagnostic code-count and file/code/line parity against the
upstream compiler. Message text and span/column are separate, non-gating
dimensions; both are green across the registered presets at this commit, which
is a statement about those fixtures and not about arbitrary code. A new preset
can record drift without failing CI, and the closed deltas are kept in
[STRICT_DRIFT_INVENTORY.md](STRICT_DRIFT_INVENTORY.md).

Projects where `tsc` reports zero diagnostics are pinned as **false-positive
corpora**, with gates of different strength: `pnpm run real:ky:test` asserts
exact 0/0, so any surge diagnostic fails it, while `pnpm run real:unnamed:test`
asserts a count ceiling (a ratchet that only moves down) and currently sits at
0. Both skip cleanly when the checkout or the `typescript` package is absent.
What this evidence does *not* establish is full TypeScript compatibility —
projects outside the covered surface can and do drift, and the known gaps are
tracked openly in [CURRENT_STATUS.md](CURRENT_STATUS.md) and
[REAL_PROJECT_COMPAT.md](REAL_PROJECT_COMPAT.md). tRPC is a measured workload,
never a parity claim.

## Performance

One recorded workload, measured at commit `f841633` on an Apple M1 Pro: the
tRPC monorepo (checkout `dfbafa8`) checks in roughly **5 s** at `--jobs auto`
with a ~1.09 GB peak physical footprint. Absolute wall figures move between
measurement rounds with machine load — only interleaved A/B pairs taken in one
session compare, and peak RSS on this workload varies ±30–50% run to run
without that discipline.

This is one project on one machine at one commit — not a compiler comparison,
and not transferable across projects, hardware, allocators, or build profiles.
What *is* a property rather than a measurement: repeated runs render
byte-identical diagnostics, and `--jobs 1` and `--jobs auto` produce identical
output. Numbers, caveats, and reproduction steps:
[CURRENT_STATUS.md](CURRENT_STATUS.md) and [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md).

## Architecture overview

The workspace is split into small crates with stable facades: parsing
(`surge-ts-syntax`), the core type representation (`surge-ts-types`), semantic
checking (`surge-ts-checker`), diagnostics catalog/rendering
(`surge-ts-diagnostics`), tsconfig loading (`surge-ts-config`), the embeddable
umbrella crate (`surge-ts`), and the CLI (`surge-ts-cli`). Project checking is
a fixed phase pipeline — config load, file discovery, import-graph expansion
(including physical `lib*.d.ts` loading from the local `typescript` package),
parse, module analysis/binding, per-file checking (serial or parallel), and
rendering.

Two design decisions carry most of the performance and determinism weight.
First, each run owns a canonical `ProgramTypeStore` that interns structural
type payloads (function types, union member lists, property maps, parameter
lists) so identical types are shared write-once `Arc`s instead of repeated
allocations; type IDs embed a program-owner tag and never cross runs, and the
store is torn down at end of run so embedders do not retain the type graph.
Second, checker options and module-resolution tables are shared immutably for
the whole run (`Arc<CheckerOptions>`) — contexts are never deep-cloned per
module, and every cross-module cache must key on declaration identity,
arguments, and environment. The rules that keep this fast and deterministic
are written down as enforceable invariants: see
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) and
[docs/PERFORMANCE_INVARIANTS.md](docs/PERFORMANCE_INVARIANTS.md).

## Scope and non-goals

In scope: `tsconfig.json` project checking with `tsc`-compatible diagnostics,
physical `lib*.d.ts` loading from the local `typescript` package,
declaration-side module resolution (`paths`, `baseUrl`, package `exports` /
`imports`, `typesVersions`, self-name, `types` / `typeRoots`, `@types`
discovery, `/// <reference types>`), JSON modules under `resolveJsonModule`,
and deterministic serial or parallel checking.

Explicitly **not** goals: emit, transforms, declaration emit, a language
service, incremental or watch checking, project references, full runtime/JS
package resolution, and full `lib.d.ts` / DOM / Node / React parity. The
current limitation list — reconstructed from probes rather than inherited from
old notes — is in [CURRENT_STATUS.md](CURRENT_STATUS.md#known-limitations).
