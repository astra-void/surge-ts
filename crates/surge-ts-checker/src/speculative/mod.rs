//! Serial-equivalent speculative check sessions.
//!
//! The six program-wide resolution caches (`program_resolved_generic_types`,
//! `program_instantiations`, and the four `physical_interface_*` caches) are
//! order-visible: whether a file's resolution *hits* an entry seeded by an
//! earlier-checked file can change a rendered type display (nominal
//! `ReadonlyArray<Auth>` vs structural `Auth[]`), so racing parallel workers
//! against the shared maps changes output bytes between runs. Normalizing the
//! hit/miss display forms is forbidden — a prior attempt changed real
//! diagnostics (see `docs/perf/SPECULATIVE-TRANSACTIONAL-CHECKING.md` §3).
//!
//! This module instead makes parallel checking *serial-equivalent*: workers
//! never write the live caches. Each worker checks files against an immutable
//! snapshot of the caches taken at fan-out plus a private overlay of its own
//! insertions, and records per file which cache keys it observed *missing*.
//! After the workers finish, a single-threaded coordinator commits files in
//! serial file order: a file whose miss-set is disjoint from everything
//! published by earlier-ordered files behaved exactly as it would have under
//! serial checking, so its speculative result and cache insertions are
//! published as-is. A file that missed a key an earlier file published (or
//! that consumed an overlay entry from a file that itself failed validation)
//! may have observed a hit/miss pattern serial checking would not produce; its
//! speculative result is discarded and the file is re-checked serially against
//! the now-committed cache state. By induction over file order the committed
//! results and final cache contents are byte-identical to a serial run.
//!
//! Conflict keys are equality-consistent structural digests
//! ([`surge_ts_types::type_conflict_digest`]); a digest collision only causes
//! a spurious (sound) recheck, never a missed conflict.
//!
//! The session is installed per worker *thread* (the `ACTIVE_TYPE_STORE`
//! pattern) rather than plumbed through `CheckerContext`, because resolution
//! can materialize shadow contexts from captured declaration environments
//! mid-check ([`crate::context::DeclarationEnvironmentHandle::checker_context`]);
//! those clones carry the same live cache `Arc`s and must route through the
//! same overlay. Contexts with deliberately isolated cache handles (e.g. the
//! export-value shadow context) are recognized by pointer identity and keep
//! their isolated behavior.
